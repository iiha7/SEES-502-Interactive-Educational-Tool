# Interactive Educational Tool for SEES 502: Energy Systems and Sustainability

This interactive tool is designed for the **SEES 502 Energy Systems and Sustainability** course at **METU NCC**.

It provides students with the opportunity to understand the crucial role of renewable energy in promoting sustainability. The tool leverages comprehensive datasets from **Our World in Data**, allowing users to explore and analyze how renewable energy adoption affects CO2 emissions.

## Key Features:

### 1. Visualizing Energy Consumption & CO2 Emissions
- View energy consumption from various sources across all countries from **2000-2022**.
- Explore the corresponding **CO2 emissions** using interactive visualizers.
- See the direct impact of different energy mixes on global greenhouse gas emissions.

### 2. Displaying CO2 Emissions Based on Energy Mix
- Display the amount of **CO2 emissions** based on any **energy mix** from all sources.
- Compare and analyze how changes in energy sources affect emissions.

By using this tool, students gain valuable insights into the **relationship between energy use and climate change**, helping them better understand the importance of adopting renewable energy solutions.

**Data** is obtained from the **Our World in Data** organization [üîó](https://ourworldindata.org/)
